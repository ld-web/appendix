## FQCN

The FQCN (Fully Qualified Class Name) is the full name of a class, which includes all of its namespaces.

Example: `Symfony\Component\HttpFoundation\Request`

Here, `Request` is the class name. The entire thing is an FQCN.

## MVC

MVC means **Model View Controller**.

It is a way of organizing an application by splitting it into 3 main layers:

- Model, for the data (DB)
- View, for the display (templates)
- Controllers, containing the business logic (code)

## Type-hint

In a Symfony application, a type-hint is written into a controller's parameters, or into a class constructor's parameters.

It is then analyzed by Symfony to find the correct service and provide an instance to the controller or the service.

### Controller

For instance, in a controller:

```php
#[Route('/new', name: 'app_article_crud_new', methods: ['GET', 'POST'])]
public function new(
    Request $request, // <-- Special type-hint: provides the incoming request as an object
    EntityManagerInterface $entityManager, // <-- Type-hint
    SluggerInterface $slugger // <-- Type-hint
): Response
{
    //...
}
```

### Service

```php
class NewsletterService
{
    public function __construct(
        private MailerInterface $mailer, // <-- Type-hint
        private string $adminEmail
    ) {
    }

    //...
}
```

> **Autowired** types can be type-hinted

## Slug

A slug is a string with no spaces, accents, special characters, etc...making it more convenient to use into a URL or a filename.

For example, if an article has the following title:

`Découvrez l'injection de dépendances dans Symfony`

Then the corresponding slug may be :

`decouvrez-l-injection-de-dependances-dans-symfony`

The article could then be visited at the following URL:

`https://domain.com/articles/decouvrez-l-injection-de-dependances-dans-symfony`

## Recipe

A recipe helps configuring a package or a bundle when installing it in an existing Symfony application. It's executed by the Symfony Flex tool.

Symfony Flex is a **Composer plugin**: when using `composer require XXX` to install a package, Symfony Flex will verify if a recipe is available for this package. A recipe will contain, for example, configuration files, or files that will be created at a determined location into the project. The goal is to facilitate the integration of a package into a Symfony application.
