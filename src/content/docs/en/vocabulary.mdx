## FQCN

The FQCN (Fully Qualified Class Name) is the full name of a class, which includes all of its namespaces.

Example: `Symfony\Component\HttpFoundation\Request`

Here, `Request` is the class name. The entire thing is an FQCN.

## MVC

MVC means **Model View Controller**.

It is a way of organizing an application by splitting it into 3 main layers:

- Model, for the data (DB)
- View, for the display (templates)
- Controllers, containing the business logic (code)
