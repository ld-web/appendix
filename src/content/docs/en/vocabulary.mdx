## FQCN

The FQCN is the **Fully Qualified Class Name**, the **full** name of a class. It is the name of the class including all of its namespaces.

Example : `Symfony\Component\HttpFoundation\Request`

Here, `Request` is the class name. The whole thing is a FQCN.

## MVC

MVC means **Model View Controller**.

It is a way of organizing an application by splitting it into 3 main layers :

- Model, for the data (DB)
- View, for the display (templates)
- Controllers, containing the business logic (code)
